# ![Campfire Needs Fuel!](https://i.imgur.com/07HgjJb.png "Campfire Needs Fuel!")

With this add-on, campfires start unlit and must be replenished with fuel to remain burning.

## How to turn it on

---

With a fire lighter, of course! Use any of the following:

- Flint and Steel
- A custom tool
  - [Earlygame](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/earlygame)'s fire starter
  - [Hardcore Torches](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/hardcore-torches)' fire starter
  - Or any other tool that produces flames!

## How to turn it off

---

Throw water on top of it, just like in vanilla.

Beware though, as **now the campfire extinguishes when its fuel gets all consumed!**

## How to prevent it from burning out

---

Throw some fuel close to it, and the campfire will absorb the fuel source automatically.

The fuel amount will increase as in the following table:

|  | Fuel | Burning Time (seconds) |
| --- | :--- | :---: |

It starts with an amount of fuel equivalent to 140 seconds of burning time, which is roughly the combined smelting time of the resources that go into the campfire recipe.

## How to check its fuel

---

Sneaking close to it displays a message on your screen that tells the remaining **seconds** left until burn out.

Usually, the sneak key is **Shift**.

## How to get the fuel back

---

If you mine (break) the campfire, you'll get back the smelting value equivalent of the added fuel, as shown in the previous table.

By default, on vanilla, when you break a campfire it drops two pieces of charcoal. That still happens! Even if the campfire has zero fuel left, it will still drop two pieces of charcoal.

When the campfire has more than the starting fuel left, it will drop the fuel as charcoal and sticks.
